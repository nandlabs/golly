// Package messaging provides a set of utilities for working with messaging systems.
// It includes functionality for sending and receiving messages, as well as managing message queues.
// This package supports various messaging protocols, including AMQP and MQTT.
// It provides a simple and consistent API for interacting with different messaging systems.
// The `Sender` type is used for sending messages, while the `Receiver` type is used for receiving messages.
// Both types provide methods for connecting to a messaging server, sending/receiving messages, and closing the connection.
//
// Note: This package requires a messaging server to be running in order to send/receive messages.
// Please refer to the documentation of the specific messaging protocol for more information on how to set up a server.
