## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find any vulnerability in our code or the API we are running, please
contact us ASAP by creating an
[Issue](https://github.com/nandlabs/golly/issues/new/choose). We do take this
very seriously.

We will respond to you as fast as we can and start working to fix the problem.
Please also keep in mind and understand that this is an open-source project and
that the maintainers also have other work to finish.
